"Test-driven development" is a popular method of writing software. The idea is that you write tests for your code first, then you write the code that gets the tests to pass. We're going to approach this project using a bit of TDD.

Use -dev flag, if you are installing packages you will use during development (take Jest as example, you wouldn't use it for production, right?), and do not if package you are installing is for production.
